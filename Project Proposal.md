### Project Objective

We will be developing a weather station which uses a Raspberry Pi as the main hub and a microcontroller to interface with the weather sensors which will talk wirelessly to the Pi over a network. The sensors that the weather station will include are: pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and possibly a rain gauge. The station will provide near-real time environmental and climate data accessible remotely via a web server running on the Pi itself. The Raspberry Pi 3 was chosen because of its built-in WiFi capability. We will be installing Apache, mySql, and Wordpress on the Pi, and will likely be purchasing a cheap domain for remote access.
